### Example Configuration-Z
I made this to show  the outputs of the data type defined in c5-ec2instance.tf
- Remove instance type variable from c2 (unnecessary, but unneeded clutter)
- Remove the creation of EC2 instances in c5
- Remove outputs and create a new output for the data type in c6

You can play with the commented output to see how we're pulling data from that data source.
